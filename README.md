# Move Thing

## What is it?

Move Thing is the most basic of Coffeescript / canvas games. It's a square. You can control it with a keyboard, a touchscreen, a gamepad, or a mouse. That's really about it.

## Why is it?

Move Thing is a very basic playground where I can develop a very simple Coffeescript game engine. The main goals of the project are to teach myself Coffeescript, and to build the core of a 2d game engine that I can use for other projcets. Components that will be developed are: core game loop, input handling, object interaction, menus, and UI.

## How do I build it, start it, and play it?

### Installing Coffeescript

I'll give you the link to Coffeescript. Beyond that point you're on your own. I trust you.

http://coffeescript.org

### Building MoveThing
To turn the Coffeescript into usable javascript, you'll have to run the coffee compiler from the command line:

    coffee -w -j lib/movething.js -c src

In the near future there will be a Cakefile which will simply the build process (by simplify I mean "shorten the command line string you have to type").

### Starting MoveThing

Doubleclick on movething.html. Enjoy!

I should mention that you should probably have a default browser that was built in this century (this decade would be preferable, but, eh, whaddaya gonna do?).

## Playing MoveThing

Use the controls to move the square! In the future, there may be a goal. Like, a target to move the square onto? Maybe even an obstacle. Who knows...
